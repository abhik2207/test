Leaves are falling,
And we are reaching autumn,
And it's been a while since we spoke.

Days are shorter and I am aching for ya.
Tryna find a little peace of mind,
But in the winter time it's too cold.

Treading softly. But the pain ain't stopping,
Have you forgotten, when spring would blossom,
The places where we would go?

Close your eyes. And do you remember smiling?
In the summer time, when the sun is shining,
But now I'm here on my own.
